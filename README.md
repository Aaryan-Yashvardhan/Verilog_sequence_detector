# Verilog_sequence_detector
Developed a sequence detector circuit using a Finite State Machine in Verilog, employing sequential circuit implementation techniques. Simulated the circuitâ€™s behavior using tools like GTKWave, ensuring accurate detection of a specific input sequence and generating the desired output based on the current state.
